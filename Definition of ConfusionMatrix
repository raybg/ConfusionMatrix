A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

Here,
• Class 1 : Positive
• Class 2 : Negative

Definition of the Terms:
• Positive (P) : Observation is positive (for example: is an apple).
• Negative (N) : Observation is not positive (for example: is not an apple).
• True Positive (TP) : Observation is positive, and is predicted to be positive.
• False Negative (FN) : Observation is positive, but is predicted negative.
• True Negative (TN) : Observation is negative, and is predicted to be negative.
• False Positive (FP) : Observation is negative, but is predicted positive.


      I       II
I     TP      FN
  
II    FP      TN





Classification Rate or Accuracy is given by the relation:

Accuracy = (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN)
